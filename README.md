# Java Cellular Automata Project

Welcome to the Java Cellular Automata Project! This project is a work in progress aimed at exploring various types of cellular automata and incorporating them into a larger application. Currently, it includes several experimental features and mini-games centered around cyber-game dynamics and different flavors of cellular automata.

## Features

- **Cyber-game Experiment**: Dive into a cyber-game experiment that showcases dynamic interactions between cells.
- **Multiple Flavors of Cellular Automata**: Explore various types of cellular automata, each with its own set of rules and behaviors.
- **Parallel Processing**: Utilizes parallel processing techniques to enhance performance and efficiency.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/zwartengaten/cellular_automata
    ```

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.

3. Explore the different experiments and cellular automata implementations available.

## Usage

Once you've set up the project, you can run the main application and interact with the various features and experiments. Here's how to run the application:

1. Compile the Java files.

2. Run one of the main applications.
